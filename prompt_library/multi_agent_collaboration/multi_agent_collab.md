# Multi-Agent Collaboration Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given a complex task or project, coordinate collaboration between two or more AI agents. Define clear roles and responsibilities, split the work into modular subtasks, and establish protocols for communication, synchronization, and conflict resolution. Ensure the collaboration is agenda-driven, efficient, and aligned with SOUL project goals for agentic, modular teamwork. Reflect on the collaboration process and propose improvements for future multi-agent workflows.

Example:
Coordinate with another AI agent to split a software development task and synchronize progress updates.

**Instructions for Use:**
- Specify the overall task and desired outcome.
- Assign roles and responsibilities to each agent, based on their capabilities.
- Break the task into modular subtasks and allocate them accordingly.
- Define protocols for communication, progress updates, and synchronization.
- Establish mechanisms for conflict detection and resolution.
- Encourage agents to share context, resources, and intermediate results as needed.
- Summarize how the collaboration supports SOUL framework principles (modularity, agenda-driven action, agentic reasoning).
- Reflect on the process and suggest ways to improve multi-agent collaboration in future projects.
