# Error Handling Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given a system, API, or codebase that interacts with external services or has potential failure points, design a robust error handling strategy. Clearly describe the context, identify possible failure scenarios, and propose mechanisms for error detection, reporting, and recovery. Ensure your approach is modular, maintainable, and aligned with SOUL project goals. Include best practices for logging, user feedback, and proactive prevention of recurring errors.

Example:
Suggest a robust error handling strategy for a Python API that interacts with external services.

**Instructions for Use:**
- Describe the context, including system boundaries and interaction points with external dependencies.
- Identify and categorize possible failure scenarios (e.g., network errors, invalid responses, timeouts).
- Propose error detection, reporting, and recovery mechanisms for each scenario.
- Recommend best practices for logging, monitoring, and alerting.
- Suggest user-facing feedback and fallback strategies where appropriate.
- Ensure the error handling approach is modular and easy to maintain.
- Summarize how the strategy aligns with SOUL framework principles (agentic reasoning, modularity, reliability).
- Reflect on the error handling process and propose improvements for future implementations.
