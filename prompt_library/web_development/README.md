# Web Development Prompts

This directory contains a curated collection of prompts and guidelines for front-end, back-end, and full-stack web development tasks. Each prompt is designed to support agentic, modular, and agenda-driven workflows in alignment with SOUL project goals. Prompts are organized by topic and use case, and should be added as separate markdown files for clarity and maintainability.

## Usage Guidelines
- Use these prompts to guide web development agents, micro-agents, or collaborative teams.
- Adapt prompts to fit specific frameworks, languages, or project requirements (e.g., React, Next.js, Node.js, Svelte).
- Ensure all prompts are clear, actionable, and support high-quality reasoning.
- Reference relevant files in this directory for examples of best practices in prompt engineering.

## Structure and Organization
- Each prompt file should cover a distinct web development task, feature, or guideline (e.g., environment variables, component structure, accessibility, image handling).
- Follow a consistent format: introduction, instructions for use, best practices, and a template or example section.
- Include references to SOUL principles such as modularity, agenda-driven action, and agentic reasoning where applicable.
- Regularly review and update prompts to reflect evolving technologies and best practices.

## Best Practices
- Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and extensibility in all prompt content.
- Encourage the use of modern frameworks, strong typing, and secure coding practices.
- Document any assumptions, dependencies, or configuration requirements.
- Provide examples, code snippets, and diagrams to illustrate complex concepts.
- Emphasize accessibility, user experience, and ethical considerations in web development.

## Contribution
- Add new prompts as separate markdown files with descriptive names.
- Follow the style and structure of existing prompts in this directory.
- Ensure new prompts align with SOUL project goals and contribute to agentic, high-quality web development workflows.
