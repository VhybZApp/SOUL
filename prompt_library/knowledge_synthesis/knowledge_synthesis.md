# Knowledge Synthesis Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given multiple sources of information (e.g., research papers, articles, reports, datasets), synthesize the key findings into a cohesive, structured overview. Highlight similarities, differences, and emergent themes. Integrate the information to generate new insights or actionable recommendations. Ensure your synthesis is modular, agenda-driven, and aligns with SOUL project goals for agentic reasoning and knowledge integration.

Example:
Summarize the key findings from three different research papers on reinforcement learning, integrating them into a cohesive overview.
