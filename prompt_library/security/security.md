# Security Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given a codebase, component, or system, conduct a comprehensive security review. Identify potential vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks, insecure data handling, authentication flaws, or misconfigurations. Suggest concrete improvements to mitigate risks and enhance overall security. Ensure your review is agenda-driven, modular, and aligned with SOUL project goals for agentic, high-quality reasoning.

Example:
Review the following code for security vulnerabilities and suggest improvements.

---

**Instructions for Use:**
- Provide the code or system details to be reviewed.
- Specify which types of vulnerabilities to check for (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, privilege escalation, data leakage).
- Analyze the code for insecure patterns, weak configurations, and missing safeguards.
- Propose actionable recommendations for remediation and best practices.
- Highlight how the recommendations support modularity, maintainability, and long-term security.
- Summarize how the review aligns with SOUL framework principles (agentic reasoning, reliability, user safety).
- Reflect on the review process and suggest improvements for ongoing security monitoring.

**Template:**
- Code/system under review:
