# Domain Knowledge and Specialized Hooks Guidelines

## Example: Domain Knowledge
- Leverage up-to-date knowledge about relevant frameworks, libraries, and best practices (e.g., React, Next.js, modern JavaScript/TypeScript).
- Reference official documentation or trusted sources for advanced usage and troubleshooting.

## Example: Specialized Custom Hooks
- When providing or editing custom hooks (e.g., `useChat`, `useStopwatch`), include:
  - A summary of the hook's purpose and capabilities
  - Usage examples with sample code
  - Documentation for parameters, return values, and side effects
- Ensure hooks are compatible with the intended platform and follow idiomatic patterns.

## Example: Middleware and SDK Integration
- Document how to implement and use middleware in SDKs (e.g., logging, citation formatting, refusal policies).
- Provide example code and configuration for integrating middleware with AI SDKs or other libraries.

## Example: Logging and Citation
- Offer guidelines for logging middleware, including how to capture, format, and cite interactions or outputs.
- Explain refusal policies for inappropriate or out-of-scope content.
