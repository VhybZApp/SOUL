# Workflow Automation Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given a repetitive or complex workflow, design and implement an automated process to improve efficiency, reliability, and scalability. Specify the project context, requirements, and desired outcomes. Provide modular, agenda-driven automation scripts or workflows (e.g., CI/CD, task runners, scheduling). Ensure your solution is maintainable, secure, and aligned with SOUL project goals for agentic, high-quality reasoning.

Example:
Automate the deployment process for a Node.js web application using a CI/CD pipeline.
