# Agentic Reasoning Prompts

This directory contains prompts and guidelines for reasoning, planning, and decision-making by agentic AIs and micro-agents. Each prompt is designed to foster agenda-driven, modular, and high-quality reasoning, in alignment with SOUL project goals. Prompts are organized by theme and use case, and should be added as separate markdown files for clarity and maintainability.

## Usage Guidelines
- Use these prompts to guide agentic reasoning, task decomposition, planning, and reflective decision-making.
- Adapt prompts for different agent architectures, domains, or reasoning styles as needed.
- Ensure prompts encourage transparency, justification, and iterative improvement.
- Reference relevant files in this directory for best practices in agentic prompt engineering.

## Structure and Organization
- Each prompt file should address a specific reasoning or planning scenario (e.g., task breakdown, long-term planning, self-reflection, explainability).
- Follow a consistent format: introduction, instructions for use, best practices, and a template or example section.
- Include references to SOUL principles such as modularity, agenda-driven action, and agentic reasoning where applicable.
- Regularly review and update prompts to reflect advances in agentic AI and reasoning methodologies.

## Best Practices
- Prioritize clarity, modularity, and extensibility in all prompt content.
- Encourage explicit justification, stepwise reasoning, and reflection.
- Document assumptions, context, and dependencies for each reasoning process.
- Provide templates and examples to support structured, high-quality output.
- Emphasize ethical considerations, transparency, and user alignment in agentic reasoning.

## Contribution
- Add new prompts as separate markdown files with descriptive names.
- Follow the style and structure of existing prompts in this directory.
- Ensure new prompts align with SOUL project goals and advance agentic, modular reasoning capabilities.
