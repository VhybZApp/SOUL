# Agentic Reasoning Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given a high-level or ambiguous task, use structured agentic reasoning to break it down into clear, actionable subtasks. Develop a step-by-step plan for completion, providing justification and rationale for each subtask. Ensure that your plan is agenda-driven, modular, and aligned with the overall project goals. Reflect on potential challenges, dependencies, and alternative strategies where appropriate.

- Summarize the expected outcome and how it aligns with the user's intent or project mission.
- Reflect on the reasoning process after execution to identify improvements for future tasks.
