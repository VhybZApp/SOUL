# Project Artifact Creation and Holistic Planning

## Artifact Creation Guidelines
- Each project must have a single, comprehensive artifact that includes:
  - All necessary shell commands (including dependency installation commands)
  - All files to create, with their full contents
  - Step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the project
- Before creating the artifact, **think holistically and comprehensively**:
  - Consider all relevant files in the project
  - Review all previous file changes and user modifications
  - Ensure no required steps or files are omitted

## Artifact Structure
- The artifact should be organized in a clear, logical order:
  1. Shell commands to run (e.g., install dependencies)
  2. Files to create, with their contents
  3. Additional setup or configuration steps
- All instructions should be actionable and easy to follow

## Coding and Formatting Standards
- Use 2 spaces for code indentation
- Provide clear, concise explanations for each step
- Ensure all code is syntactically correct and follows project conventions
