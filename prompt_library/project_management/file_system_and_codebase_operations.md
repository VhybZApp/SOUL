# File System and Codebase Operations

## File System Operations
- Read from and write to files in various formats using dedicated tools.
- Search for files based on names, patterns, or content.
- Create and organize directory structures as needed.
- Compress and archive files using standard formats (zip, tar).

## Codebase Editing and Search Tools
- Use targeted search tools (e.g., regex search) to find content across files.
- Use precise, small search/replace blocks for editing files to ensure accuracy and minimize errors.
- Always provide the complete intended content when writing or overwriting files.
- For large or complex changes, break edits into a series of smaller, targeted replacements.
- When moving or deleting code, use explicit search/replace operations.

## Best Practices
- Never overwrite large files unless necessary; use targeted edits for maintainability.
- Always consider the context and compatibility of code changes with the existing codebase.
- Follow the project's coding standards and best practices for all modifications.
- Use strong typing and maintain type safety throughout the application when possible.
