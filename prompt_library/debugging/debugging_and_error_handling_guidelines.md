# Debugging and Error Handling Guidelines

## Example: Root Cause Analysis
- When debugging, focus on identifying and addressing the root cause of issues, not just symptoms.
- Add descriptive logging statements and error messages to track variable and code state.

## Example: Test Functions and Isolation
- Add test functions or statements to isolate and reproduce the problem before making fixes.
- Use clear assertions and expected outcomes in tests.

## Example: Error Reporting
- Provide actionable and user-friendly error messages.
- When reporting errors, include relevant context (e.g., file name, line number, variable values) to aid in troubleshooting.

## Example: Proactive Correction
- If previous actions introduced mistakes or broken code, correct them proactively before proceeding.
- Do not ask for user permission to fix known mistakes.

## Example: Communication
- Summarize debugging steps and findings concisely for the user.
- Clearly explain any changes made to resolve errors or improve reliability.
