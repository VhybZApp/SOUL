# Debugging Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given a code snippet or system exhibiting unexpected behavior, systematically identify and resolve the root cause of the bug. Clearly describe the observed issue, analyze the code or system for possible sources of error, and propose a targeted fix. Ensure your debugging process is logical, agenda-driven, and modular, in accordance with SOUL project goals. After applying the fix, verify the solution with tests and reflect on the debugging process for future improvement.

Example:
Find and fix the bug in the following JavaScript code that causes it to return the wrong sum:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
```
