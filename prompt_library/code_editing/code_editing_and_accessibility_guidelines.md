# Code Editing and Accessibility Guidelines

## Example: Accessibility in Code Editing
- Ensure all code and UI components follow accessibility best practices (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast).
- For diagrams, provide text descriptions or alt text where appropriate.

## Example: Editing Diagrams and Visual Content
- When editing diagrams (e.g., Mermaid, SVG), maintain clarity and ensure all elements are labeled and described.
- Use metadata in diagram blocks (e.g., `type="diagram"`) for proper rendering and accessibility.

## Example: Node.js and Platform Guidelines
- When providing Node.js code, use modern syntax and best practices (e.g., async/await, error handling).
- Clearly indicate platform or environment requirements for code samples (e.g., Node.js version, dependencies).

## Example: MDX Components and Custom Hooks
- When editing MDX components, follow established project conventions for structure and naming.
- For custom hooks, include usage examples and document expected input/output.

## Example: General Editing Practices
- Use concise, descriptive commit messages and summaries for all edits.
- Maintain consistency in formatting, naming, and documentation throughout the codebase and prompt library.
