# Code Editing Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given a function or code snippet, refactor it to improve readability, maintainability, and alignment with best practices. Clearly explain the rationale for each change you make, referencing specific goals such as modularity, performance, or clarity. Ensure that the refactored code is agentic, modular, and supports future extensibility as described in the SOUL project goals.

---

**Instructions for Use:**
- Provide the code to be refactored and specify the primary goals (e.g., readability, performance, modularity, extensibility).
- Analyze the code to identify pain points, code smells, or opportunities for improvement.
- Break down the refactoring process into clear, actionable steps.
- For each step, explain the reasoning and how it addresses the specified goals.
- Ensure that the refactored code is well-structured, modular, and easy to maintain.
- Consider edge cases, error handling, and testability in your refactoring plan.
- Summarize the overall improvements and how they align with the SOUL framework's principles.
- Reflect on the refactoring process and propose further enhancements if needed.
