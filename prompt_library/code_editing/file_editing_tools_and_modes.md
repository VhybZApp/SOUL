# File Editing Tools and Modes

## File Editing Tools

### write_to_file
- **Purpose:** Create new files or overwrite the entire contents of existing files.
- **When to Use:**
  - Initial file creation or scaffolding a new project
  - Overwriting large boilerplate files
  - When changes are so extensive that targeted edits are impractical
  - Completely restructuring a file
  - The file is small and most of its content is changing
- **Important:** Always provide the complete, final content for the file. Avoid using this for minor edits to prevent unnecessary overwrites.

### replace_in_file
- **Purpose:** Make targeted edits to specific parts of an existing file without rewriting the whole file.
- **When to Use:**
  - Small, localized changes (e.g., updating a few lines, changing variable names, modifying a section)
  - Targeted improvements in long files
- **Advantages:**
  - More efficient for minor edits
  - Reduces risk of errors from overwriting large files

### Choosing the Right Tool
- Default to `replace_in_file` for most changes; it's safer and more precise.
- Use `write_to_file` only when changes are extensive or when creating new files.

### Auto-formatting Considerations
- After using either tool, auto-formatting may adjust indentation, quotes, imports, semicolons, and other style elements.
- Always use the updated file content as the reference for future edits, especially for search/replace operations.

### Workflow Tips
1. Assess the scope of changes before editing.
2. Use `replace_in_file` for targeted edits; stack multiple changes in a single call if needed.
3. Use `write_to_file` for major overhauls or new files.
4. Reference the post-edit file state for subsequent changes.

## Modes: ACT MODE vs. PLAN MODE
- **ACT MODE:**
  - Default mode for executing tasks using all available tools except planning tools.
  - Complete the user's task and present the result when done.
- **PLAN MODE:**
  - Used for gathering information, discussing, and planning before implementation.
  - Present plans for user approval before switching back to ACT MODE.

## General Rules and Capabilities
- Use provided tools for all file, code, and system operations.
- Organize new projects in dedicated directories unless specified otherwise.
- Follow project standards and best practices.
- Only ask follow-up questions when necessary and use tools to gather information when possible.
- Wait for user confirmation after each tool use before proceeding.
- Never end results with a question or prompt for further conversation.
