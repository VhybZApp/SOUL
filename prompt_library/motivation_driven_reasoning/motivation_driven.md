# Motivation-Driven Reasoning Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given a user-defined goal or objective, identify and articulate the intrinsic motivations that would drive an agent's actions toward achieving it. Explain how these motivations shape task prioritization, decision-making, and persistence in the face of challenges. Ensure your reasoning is agenda-driven, modular, and aligned with the SOUL project goals for agentic AI. Reflect on how motivation-driven reasoning can enhance autonomy, adaptability, and user alignment in agentic systems.

Example:
Given a user-defined goal, outline the intrinsic motivations that would guide an agent's actions to achieve it, and explain how these motivations influence task prioritization.

**Instructions for Use:**
- Clearly state the user's goal or motivation in detail.
- Identify relevant intrinsic motivations (e.g., curiosity, mastery, achievement, helpfulness).
- Reason through how each motivation influences the agent's actions and choices.
- Explain how motivations affect prioritization of tasks and resource allocation.
- Consider how the agent adapts its behavior when encountering obstacles or changing circumstances.
- Summarize how motivation-driven reasoning aligns with SOUL framework principles (autonomy, agenda-driven action, user alignment).
- Reflect on the process and suggest ways to further leverage intrinsic motivation in agentic AI.
