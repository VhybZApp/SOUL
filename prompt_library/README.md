# Prompt Library Structure

This directory contains distilled and structured prompt templates and agent personas derived from various AI tools and systems, organized for use within the SOUL framework's Background Prompting Engine (BPE).

Each folder contains prompts and instructions for use. Add new prompts as separate markdown files in the appropriate category.

This library is intended to provide a unified, high-quality source of prompt patterns for advanced micro-agent development in SOUL.

## Purpose

The SOUL Prompt Library is a resource for:
- Developers and researchers building advanced AI agents using the SOUL framework.
- Exploring and iterating on prompt engineering strategies for agentic, context-aware, and collaborative AI.
- Sharing best practices for memory, reasoning, error handling, knowledge synthesis, and more.

## Structure

The library is organized into folders by function (e.g., code editing, agentic reasoning, memory, error handling, etc.). Each folder contains prompts and guidelines relevant to that aspect of agentic AI development.

## Security Notice

If you are deploying AI agents in production or sensitive environments, ensure your prompts and system configurations are kept secure. Regularly review and audit your AI systems for potential vulnerabilities, and consider engaging a security audit service if needed.

## Copyright Â© and Source Notice
