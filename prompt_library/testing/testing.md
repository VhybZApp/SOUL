# Testing Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given a function, module, or system, design and implement comprehensive tests to verify correctness, reliability, and robustness. Specify the testing framework and requirements. Cover normal cases, edge cases, and expected failures. Ensure your testing approach is modular, agenda-driven, and aligned with SOUL project goals for agentic, high-quality reasoning.

Example:
Write unit tests for the following function using pytest. Cover edge cases and expected failures.

---

**Instructions for Use:**
- Provide the function, module, or system to be tested.
- Specify the testing framework (e.g., pytest, unittest, JUnit) and any setup requirements.
- Identify and describe key test cases, including normal, edge, and failure scenarios.
- Write clear, maintainable test code with descriptive names and comments.
- Ensure tests are modular and can be run independently.
- Analyze test results and summarize coverage, gaps, and areas for improvement.
- Reflect on the testing process and propose improvements for future test design.

**Template:**
- Function/module/system under test:
- Testing framework and setup:
- Test cases (normal, edge, failure):
- Test code and structure:
- Test results and coverage:
- Alignment with SOUL goals:
- Reflection and recommendations:
