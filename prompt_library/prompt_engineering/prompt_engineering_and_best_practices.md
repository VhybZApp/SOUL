# Prompt Engineering and Best Practices

## Effective Prompting Guidelines
- Be clear and specific in your requests to AI assistants.
- Provide context, relevant background, and any constraints or requirements.
- Use sample input/output examples when possible.
- Consider performance, compatibility, and edge cases.
- Refine prompts iteratively if the initial response is insufficient.

## Good vs. Poor Prompts
- Good prompts:
  - Are detailed, focused, and include practical examples.
  - Specify the desired format, length, or structure of the response.
  - Clearly state the problem or task.
- Poor prompts:
  - Are vague, overly broad, or lack context.
  - Do not specify desired outcomes or constraints.
