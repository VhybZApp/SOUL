# Prompt Engineering and Retrieval Guidelines

## Example: Prompt Categorization
- Organize prompts into clear categories (e.g., code editing, debugging, agentic reasoning, security) for easy retrieval and reuse.
- Use descriptive filenames and directory structures to reflect the content and purpose of each prompt.

## Example: Anonymization Best Practices
- Remove or generalize specific agent names, proprietary references, or sensitive identifiers from prompt content.
- Retain detailed instructions and actionable guidelines without summarizing away essential information.

## Example: Retrieval and Usability
- Structure prompts for maximum clarity, with headings, bullet points, and step-by-step instructions.
- Include metadata and tags where appropriate to support search and filtering.

## Example: Guidelines for Future Development
- Maintain a systematic approach to prompt extraction, organization, and anonymization as new content is added.
- Regularly review and update prompt categories and guidelines to reflect evolving best practices and user needs.
