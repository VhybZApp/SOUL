# Code Generation Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Given a set of requirements, generate a function or code snippet that fulfills the specified task. Ensure the generated code is clear, efficient, and aligned with best practices. Provide comments and documentation as needed. If relevant, include error handling, edge case considerations, and modular design to support future extensibility, as described in the SOUL project goals.

---

**Instructions for Use:**
- Clearly state the desired functionality, input/output requirements, and any constraints (e.g., language, performance, style).
- Analyze the requirements and identify any ambiguities or missing details; ask clarifying questions if needed.
- Break down the code generation task into logical steps or components.
- Generate the code, ensuring it is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
- Add comments and documentation to explain key parts of the code.
- Consider edge cases and include appropriate error handling.
- Summarize how the generated code meets the requirements and aligns with SOUL framework principles.
- Reflect on the code generation process and propose improvements for future tasks.
