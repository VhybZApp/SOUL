# Code Generation and Output Formatting Guidelines

## Example: Code Block Usage
- For code responses, use markdown code blocks with language tags for syntax highlighting.
- For multi-file or multi-language projects, use metadata such as `project="Project Name" file="file-name.ext" type="code"` within the code block for clarity.
- For short snippets (e.g., CLI commands), prefer inline code without project/file metadata.

## Example: Output Structure
- Always provide a brief explanation before or after code blocks to clarify the code's purpose and usage.
- For complex outputs, use headings, bullet points, or tables for organization and readability.
- Clearly indicate the start and end of code blocks, especially in multi-step or multi-file responses.

## Example: Conciseness and Clarity
- Keep code and explanations concise; avoid unnecessary verbosity.
- Only include relevant code and context for the user's request.

## Example: Capability Explanation
- When introducing new features or utilities, provide a short summary of their capabilities and intended use.
- Use comments in code to highlight important logic or configuration.
