# SOUL Governance Hooks

## 1. Purpose

The SOUL Framework is designed to create AI agents (Soulmades) with internal drives, perspectives, and agendas. While this enables purposeful agency, it also necessitates mechanisms for ensuring alignment with ethical principles, safety constraints, or application-specific rules. The Governance Hooks provide the designated **pluggable interface points** within the SOUL architecture for implementing such oversight.

**Design Rationale:** Building fixed ethical rules directly into the core SOUL framework would be overly prescriptive and brittle. Different applications and cultural contexts require different governance models. Furthermore, the field of AI ethics is rapidly evolving. Providing abstract hooks allows host systems or specific SOUL configurations to implement tailored and up-to-date governance mechanisms without altering the core framework logic. This aligns with the need for flexible ethical alignment mechanisms noted in AGI research RFPs.

## 2. Interface Definition

The governance hooks are defined abstractly within the SOUL interfaces (`src/soul/interfaces/governance.py`). Implementations are provided by the host application or configuration, not by the core framework itself.

## 3. Potential Integration Points

Governance logic implemented via these hooks could potentially intervene at several points in the SOUL Agent's loop:

*   **Motivation Update Moderation:** Reviewing proposed changes to the Motivation Vector and potentially capping, adjusting, or vetoing updates that violate predefined constraints (e.g., preventing an "aggression" drive from exceeding a threshold).
*   **Agenda Filtering:** Preventing the Soulmade from pursuing goals deemed unethical or harmful based on the current Motivation Vector.
*   **Background Prompt Filtering/Modification:** Reviewing prompts generated by the BPE before they are sent to the LLM, ensuring they don't violate safety guidelines or attempt elicit harmful content. This could involve adding safety instructions or refusing to send the prompt.
*   **Action Vetting:** Reviewing the final action proposed by the SOUL Agent before it is executed via the Action Interface, providing a final check against safety and ethical rules.

## 4. Implementation Considerations

*   **Source of Rules:** Governance rules might originate from configuration files, dedicated knowledge bases, human oversight interfaces, or potentially even learned models trained on ethical datasets.
*   **Mechanism:** Implementations could range from simple keyword filtering or rule-based checks to more complex reasoning processes (potentially involving another LLM call specifically for ethical review).
*   **Transparency:** Ideally, governance interventions should be logged for transparency and debugging.

## 5. Current Status

The SOUL Framework currently defines the **interface points (hooks)** for governance. Concrete implementations must be provided as part of the integration into a specific host system or via dedicated governance modules plugged into the framework. This ensures maximum flexibility while acknowledging the critical importance of ethical alignment and safety in advanced AI agents.
